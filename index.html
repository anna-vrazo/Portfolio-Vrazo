         <h3>About Anna</h3>
         <p>Based in Chicago IL, or the Windy City as it is sometimes referred to. I am currently in progress of completing the Thinkful course for Software Engineering. In my spare time when I am not studying I am a motorcycle instructor as well ad a Drivers Ed instructor. I am also attending school for Mechanical Engineering. I love to learn new things and want to challenge myself for a brighter future. Coding has somthing that I have wanted to take on for awhile and though it is challanging it is incrediably rewarding once you make something come alive.</p>
